                <h3>Create a Debt Repayment Plan</h3>
                <p>Start by listing all your debts, from credit cards to student loans. Prioritize paying off debts with the highest interest rates first.</p>

                <h3>Consolidate Debt</h3>
                <p>Debt consolidation can simplify your repayments by merging multiple debts into a single loan, often with a lower interest rate.</p>

                <h3>Avoid New Debt</h3>
                <p>Limit your borrowing while you're focusing on repaying existing debts. This will keep your debt levels from increasing further.</p>
